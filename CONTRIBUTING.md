## Code of Conduct

We value and maintain a welcoming, inclusive, and respectful community. We expect all contributors to adhere to our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to create a positive environment for everyone. Please read it before participating.

## How to Contribute

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary) to standardize our commit messages, making it easier to understand the purpose of each commit. Please follow these guidelines when making commits:

- Use the format `type(scope): description` for your commit messages.
- The `type` should be one of:
  - `feat`: for new features
  - `fix`: for bug fixes
  - `chore`: for routine tasks and maintenance
  - `docs`: for documentation updates
  - `style`: for code style changes
  - `refactor`: for code refactoring
  - `test`: for adding or updating tests
- The `scope` is optional but can be used to specify the part of the project affected by the commit.
- The `description` should be a concise summary of your changes.

For example:
- `feat(login): add new user authentication feature`
- `fix(api): resolve issue with data parsing`
